## ideas
- check similar images between different channels as well, they can be immediate hints for simple localization
- check for outlines: for many cases, molecules may either fill a compartment, or localize on the membrane surfaces
- some marker channels got no signals, drop them from training and develop code to drop when encountered
- check out ImageJ scripts
