- [x] check similar images between different channels as well, they can be immediate hints for simple localization
- [x] check for outlines: for many cases, molecules may either fill a compartment, or localize on the membrane surfaces
  - image segmentation: mask_rcnn
- [ ] some marker channels got no signals, drop them from training and develop code to drop when encountered
- [x] check out ImageJ scripts - no need now

---

## image segmentation
- rcnn, faster-rcnn, mask-rcnn
- u-net

## On-going
- Resnet training on 4 channels with pytorch fastai

### Dropout
- increase dropout to reduce batch effects from same image stacks

### Features
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5193229
-- corr/overlap between protein & nuc/ microtubule /ER channels
-- variance of # pixels per objects
-- object size
-- texture
- SVM & RF

###  Pretrained models
- https://github.com/osmr/imgclsmob
- `pip install pytorchcv torch>=0.4.0`

### U-Net
- https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/
- Image segmentation model that handles touching & overlapping cells
- [ ] Image augmentation: irrgular deform
